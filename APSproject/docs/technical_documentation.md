# Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

The search engine is built using several key components that work together to provide efficient search, autocomplete, and spell-checking capabilities.

### Core Components

1. **SearchEngine Class**
   - Main interface for all operations
   - Manages document addition, searching, and index maintenance
   - Coordinates between different components

2. **InvertedIndex Class**
   - Implements an inverted index data structure
   - Maps terms to documents containing them
   - Stores term frequency information
   - Time Complexity: O(1) for lookups

3. **TFIDFCalculator Class**
   - Implements TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scoring
   - Used for ranking search results
   - Formula: score = tf * log(N/df)
     - tf: term frequency in document
     - N: total number of documents
     - df: number of documents containing term

4. **Trie Class**
   - Implements prefix tree for autocomplete
   - Space-efficient storage of terms
   - Time Complexity: O(m) for lookups, where m is key length

5. **SpellCorrector Class**
   - Implements Levenshtein distance algorithm
   - Suggests corrections for misspelled words
   - Time Complexity: O(n*m) where n,m are word lengths

6. **HuffmanCompression Class**
   - Implements Huffman coding for index compression
   - Reduces storage space requirements
   - Maintains fast decompression speed

## Algorithms

### Search Algorithm
1. Tokenize query into terms
2. Look up documents for each term
3. Calculate TF-IDF scores
4. Merge results and sort by score
5. Return top K results

```cpp
vector<pair<string, double>> search(string query) {
    auto tokens = tokenize(query);
    map<string, double> scores;
    
    for (auto& token : tokens) {
        auto docs = index.getDocuments(token);
        for (auto& doc : docs) {
            scores[doc] += calculateTFIDF(token, doc);
        }
    }
    
    return sortAndLimit(scores, K);
}
```

### Autocomplete Algorithm
1. Convert prefix to lowercase
2. Traverse trie to prefix node
3. Collect all words under that node
4. Sort by frequency
5. Return top N suggestions

### Spell Checking Algorithm
1. Calculate Levenshtein distance to known words
2. Filter words within maximum distance
3. Sort by frequency and distance
4. Return top M suggestions

## Performance Characteristics

- Search: O(k * log n) where k is query length, n is document count
- Autocomplete: O(p + m) where p is prefix length, m is number of completions
- Spell Check: O(l * v) where l is word length, v is vocabulary size
- Index Updates: O(w * log n) where w is document word count

## Memory Usage

- Inverted Index: O(T) where T is total terms across all documents
- Trie: O(C) where C is total characters in vocabulary
- Compression: Typically reduces index size by 40-60%

## Limitations

1. Case sensitivity in certain operations
2. Memory constraints for very large document sets
3. Language-specific assumptions in tokenization
4. Single-machine implementation

## Future Improvements

1. Distributed index support
2. Real-time indexing
3. Advanced query syntax
4. Multilingual support
5. Relevance feedback
6. Caching layer

## Error Handling

The implementation uses C++ exceptions for error handling:
- FileNotFound
- InvalidDocument
- IndexCorruption
- MemoryExhaustion

## Thread Safety

- Read operations are thread-safe
- Write operations require external synchronization
- Index updates are atomic

## Configuration

Key parameters that can be tuned:
- Maximum search results (K)
- Minimum term frequency
- Maximum edit distance for spell checking
- Compression level
- Cache size
