This is a sample document for testing our enhanced search engine.
It contains various words that we can search for and test different features.
The search engine should be able to find this document when we search
for relevant terms like "sample", "search", "document", or "engine".

We can also test the spell correction feature with words like
"searchh" or "dokument" which should suggest correct spellings.

The autocomplete feature should work when we type partial words
like "sear" or "doc" and suggest complete words from this text.
