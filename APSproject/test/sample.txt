Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with many layers to analyze various factors of data.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is another important application of machine learning. It helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. Common NLP tasks include text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

The field of artificial intelligence continues to evolve rapidly, with new breakthroughs happening regularly. Researchers are working on making AI systems more efficient, interpretable, and capable of handling complex tasks.
